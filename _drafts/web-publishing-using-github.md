# Web Publishing Interface

That first article I wrote was done using VIM in the command line. This one is getting done using Github's web interface for editing files. This is my first experience with this interface.

## Problems

I'll get the bad stuff out of the way first.

### Unverified Email

Inititally, because this was a new account, I didn't have an email address verified. If you check the [commit history](https://github.com/shortpgh/site/commits/gh-pages/index.html) of index.html, you'll see that I made a few commits. None of these were showing up on the site. I saw a few emails a later in the day notifying me that my publish failed because I didn't have a verified email. I got my email verified and then made another change. This one got published. So make sure you validate your email address before using the web interface.

### Multiple Accounts


## Good Stuff

### Instant Access

I had a sudden hunch to make a change to the site from a computer that didn't have the repository on it. Instead of cloning a new branch on this machine, I opened the file in the Github interface, made the change, and committed it. Very easy and very quick. Then I decided to write about this experience. And in a few clicks, this article was born.
