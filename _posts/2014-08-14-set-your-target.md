have you ever tried to throw a ball at a target? 
now, have you ever tried to do this with your eyes
closed? if you have, i bet you missed the target. do
you know why you missed? you're right, you couldn't see your target.

how does that relate to your career? easy. your goals are your targets. so do
you have goals? have you written them down? read them often?
plan how to accomplish them? if not, you are throwing a ball with your eyes
closed. or, specifically, you are doing your work with your eyes closed.

managing time, communicating well, being a leader, and all of the other
skills that we try to develop are useless without goals. 

before you go any further, you need to set your goals. sit down and write them
down. do it in a notebook or on your phone -- somewhere that you can access
often. this is step one. now, just as important, you need to
read your goals daily, or more often if you like. 

all of a sudden, you begin to see your goals in everything that you do. it's like standing back to throw
that ball, opening your eyes, and realizing that the target is actually to your
left. before you know it, you start to achieve your goals. it's strange how it
works, but this first step, setting your goals, is half the battle. 

be aware, there is work to be done to achieve your goals. you can't become,
say, the next steve jobs, by just writing it down. but if you take this one step --
set your goals and read them daily -- you'll be much closer to reaching them
tomorrow than you are today.
