    <h2>Working with SASS Source Maps</h2>
    <p>Start by installing the pre-release version of SASS.</p>

    <p>Then run SASS using the --source-maps flag.</p>
    <code class="highlight">sass --watch --sourcemap sass/screen.scss:css/screen.css</code>

    <h2>Setup Workspaces</h2>
    <p>Workspaces provides the ability for you to edit your Javascript, CSS, and
    SASS files right in your DevTools. It makes for quick editing of files while
    fixing bugs and making visual tweaks. It's powerful enough that you could
    leave your standard editor behind and develop this code right in the
    browser.</p>
