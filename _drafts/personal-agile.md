blurb: Using software team management practices in my daily life.

As a software developer, I used to work with a team that used
an agile software development process. It was a great way to work. 
Showing up and getting things done felt easy. Sure, there were difficulties and
distractions, but I always had a goal and a task and a sense of accomplishment
when they were finished. 

But agile left my daily life. As I moved through different roles -- management
and not -- I missed those practices. My roles became more singular than team
based. I still worked closely with agile, but usually on the outside looking in.
I pushed it on teams I managed, researched new ways to do things, and help other
people understand it. In my mind, for some reason, I believed these agile
practices were for teams. So I always focused on how these methods would work
for a team.

I found myself feeling like most people do. Sometimes
it was hard to focus on the important tasks. Other times it was hard to feel a
sense of accomplishment. And it was always hard not to feel overwhelmed.

So I did what a lot of you do -- I started trying new productivity
techniques. Books, lists, goals, calendars, apps -- I tried anything I could
find.  Most failed for some reason or another, but some worked. And when I
started to reflect on what worked, I found stunning similarities to agile.

This was a revalation. It changed the way I approach agile. I started to look for ways to incorporate
agile practices into my daily life. It isn't just teams. It is really for
indivudals in the team. From self organizing to backlogs to retrospectives,
it all helps the members of the team work in a way to make the team better.  

This is about when I came to the term "personal agile". Personal agile is
incorporating agile practices into your everyday life. It's goal it to make you
a more productive member of your teams. Self organization. Prioritization.
Reviews. All of these things make you work better.

And yes, I said "teams" above. That was on purpose. This is more than just ways
to improve your life at work. It's also to help improve your job at home. How
you work with your spouse, family, and friends. How you work with you the
organizations you are a member of.

As I continue to write on this blog, I'm going to continue to discuss personal
agile. I'll cover the principles that I use and how I incorporatve them into my
life. And I'll cover how you can bring these to your team. If it's not agile
already, you can help make it agile. And if it is agile, you can help make it
better.
