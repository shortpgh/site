I've wanted to start a blog for a long time. When Github pages was originally
announced, I didn't have a blog and thought about using that as a platform to
start one. But at the time, I didn't know what to write about. So I forgot about
Github pages.

Recently, I've made it a personal goal to start writing. I already started doing
this on my employer's blog, but I also want my own place to write. And at the
same time, I started hearing some great discussions about both Github pages and
Jekyll on podcasts. This reminded me of my interest in Github Pages.

I chose github pages because I find it to be developer friendly. It allows me to
write my posts in VIM. It lets me write my own style sheets and use a
pre-processor like Stylus and Sass.
