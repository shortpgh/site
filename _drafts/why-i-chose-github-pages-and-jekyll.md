blurb: Why I chose to use Github pages as my blogging platform..
tags: hello world

I've wanted to start a blog for a long time. While thinking about it, I've
looked at a lot of different options. I liked Github pages when I first read the
announcement a few years back. I actually decided at that time that it would be
my blogging platform when I decided to start writing (yea, I've been thinking
about doing this for a long time). Here are some of the reasons why I chode
Github pages.

My top reason is because it is a developer's platform. Github has made it's name
providine a service to developers. When looking at blogging platforms, I couldn't find a more
developer friendly platform. I get to use git to manage my writing. I can chose
most of the tools that are involved with building my blog. Most of the managment
requires working with the command line. And I can write my posts in my choice of environment.

The next reason is for it's simplicity of setup. Most platforms
that are this flexible require you to have a server setup. This usually ends up with
me in a mess of server setup and maintenance. That can require more time and
energy than writing the posts. I like doing that work when working on my web
apps, but not so much when trying to write blog posts. This platform keeps it
very simple. After starting your repo and [following some instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-project-pages-manually://help.github.com/categories/20/articles), you have
your blog up, running, and capable of getting more blog posts.

A third reason is openess. Everything that I do is available to the public on
Github, from the code I write to the writings I publish. But it offers the
easy management of a closed-source platform. I can also choose the way I write
CSS, write my own javascript, and markup my HTML the way I prefer.

A final reason is that I can write my posts in Vim or in a web interface. I
spend most of my time working in Vim, so I love that I can flip over and write a
quick blog post without changing the environment I am normally in. But when I
need to, typically away from my computer, the option to write posts using a web
interface exists. This is especially helpful when I want to do some writing from
my phone.
