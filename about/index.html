    <p>
    My name is 
    <span itemprop="name">Nik Mihalick</span>. 
    <span itemprop="description">I develop the web with 
    <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Organization">
    <a href="//elliance.com" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Elliance</span></a></span>, 
    write at <a href="shortpgh.com" itemprop="url">shortpgh.com</a> (here), tweet 
    <a href="http://github.com/shortpgh/">@shortpgh</a>, and occasionally commit to 
    <a href="http://github.com/shortpgh/">github.com/shortpgh</a>.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
    I've been working on the web since before it hit 2.0. During this time,
    I've helped build apps used during disasters, helped waterfalls become
    agile, lead teams of software engineers, and managed software products.
    </p>
    <p>
    I love all things Javascript, spend significant time with PHP, C#, CSS,
    SASS, Linux, FreeBSD, and work on many types of databases (SQL or not).
