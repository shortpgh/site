Static web apps are lowering the barrier for startups and new app development. They offer a way to create full featured apps quickly at low costs. Look at the [winners](http://www.staticshowdown.com/app/winners) of the static showdown for examples of what these apps can do. The apps include a chat with video, a project management tool, a game, a dating service, and a B2B service. All of these were built in a weekend and have no back-end infrastructure to maintain.

But what does this mean for budding entrepreneurs? It means that you can create your minimum viable product in a weekend. And not just a cheap and clunky looking app. The tools available making static web apps allow you to create an interactive experience, connect users, and store loads of data.

[AngularJs](http://angularjs.org/), [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/), and similar front-end frameworks help you huild interactive interfaces. [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) help give the app have a professional look and feel. Combined, these tools make it look like you have a team of front-end specialists working on your app.

Services like [GoInstant](https://goinstant.com/) and [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/) give you the ability to store all of your data. [Userapp](https://www.userapp.io/) will manage all of your user account needs. And [Divshot.io](http://www.divshot.io/) and [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/) let you to host your app without managing a server.

I know that using a bunch of third party services sounds expensive. But really it isn’t. It can cost you less than $20 a month to run your app. Using GoInstant, you can support 1000 active users and store 8GBs of data for free. Userapp lets you register and manage up to 1000 users for $9 a month. Github Pages will cost from 0-$7 monthly to host your app. Adding this up, you can run your app for a year for $240.

Learning all of these tools can sound intimidating. The great thing is, you only need to know the same technologies that are used to build websites. There are plenty of tutorials and online schools to teach the programming needed. If programming is intimidating to you, then you will need to hire someone. These tools are well known to developers everywhere. Finding someone to help shouldn’t be hard to find. There are a lot of freelancers out there. And there are even more developers that would be interested in hacking on your app in their spare time.

Do you have a great idea for a web app but don’t know where to start? If so, you can build it as a static web app and create in a weekend. If you don’t know someone that has that experience, feel free to [contact me](mailto:nik@shortpgh.com). I like building this stuff.
