        My name is Nik Mihalick. I develop the web with <a href="//elliance.com">Elliance</a>, 
        write at shortpgh.com (here), tweet 
        <a href="http://github.com/shortpgh/">@shortpgh</a>, and commit to 
        <a href="http://github.com/shortpgh/">github.com/shortpgh</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've been working in the web since before it hit 2.0. During this time,
        I've helped build apps used during disasters, helped waterfalls become
        agile, lead teams of software engineers, and managed software products.
    </p>
    <p>
        I love all things Javascript, spend significant time with php, c#, CSS,
        SASS, Linux, FreeBSD, and all types of databases (SQL or not).

        This site is hosted with github pages, published with Jekyll, and
        written in markdown with vim.
