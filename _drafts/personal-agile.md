blurb: Using software team management practices in my daily life.

I am a software engineer / web developer. I used to work on a team that followed
a very good agile software development process. During that time, it was easy to
show up to work and get my job done. Sure, there were difficulties and
distractions, but I always knew what my current task was so that I could focus
on getting it done. But working that way didn't last -- at least not for me. 

But agile left my daily life. As I moved into management, I still worked with
agile practices, but on the
outside looking in. Then I moved back to an engineering role with a comany that didn't
have a formal development methodology. 

I found myself missing the structures and tennets of the agile world. Sometimes
it was hard to focus on the important tasks. Other times it was hard to feel a
sense of accomplishment.

I was always a fan of agile. And I always did a lot of research into it. Hell,
part of my job for a long time was working with and tweaking the processes me
and my teams used. So, when I found myself without agile, I subconsiously
started finding ways to use agile practices to manage my daily life.

Once I realized I was doing this, I started to actively apply agile to my life.
You don't need to work in a team to use agile practices. And you don't need to
work for an agile company to practice agile. These practices can be effective
even if your company uses waterfall or other traditional methods. No matter your
situation, this can make you more productive. And being more productive is a
great way to feel great.

Overall, It's been a great way to manage myself, my tasks at work, my tasks at home, and
my life's goals. I'll continue to touch on this in other writings to explain how
I've incorporated these practices in my daily life.
