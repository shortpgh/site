# Getting started with Github pages

In this (my first) article, I'm following my initial setup with GitHub Pages. I
thought this was a good place to start writing. I'm going to keep writing about
this topic while I set this up.

## The Start

I started with a new repository named 'site' (for lack of a better name). Before
taking my next step, I browsed [github's
help](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-project-pages-manually://help.github.com/categories/20/articles)
on the topic.

## The Orphan Branch

Since I just started a new repo, I wasn't too worried about starting with a
fresh clone as Github suggests. So I created the orphan branch right away and followed the
rest of the instructions
[here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-project-pages-manually).

## A working Site?

With those instructions done, I visited [my site] (http://shortpgh.github.io/site).

I was getting a 404 error at first. The instructions do say it can take some
time, so I sat back and waited a bit. And then it was there. My first github
site is live.

## A Quick Referece

Before moving on, I wanted to make a quick reference sheet so I don't forget how
to do this later. So I created a [reference guide](/reference/githup-pages.md).
I'll be updating this as I continue through this process.

## Oh, What about THIS?

And before I forget, I wrote this article as I was going along. I placed it in
an article directory with hopes that there is more to come. You'll also notice I
wrote this and the reference guide in [Markdown][md]. If you don't know what
[Markdown][md] is, I highly suggest checking it out. And then bookmark it's [syntact
guide][md-ref].

I published both of these articles.

## Pretty Easy, Huh?

This first step was pretty easy. With exception of the ~10-minute wait for the
site to show up and the time writing, this only took a few minutes to setup.
