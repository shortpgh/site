I competed with a small team in the [static showdown](http://www.staticshowdown.com/) over the weekend. The goal of the challenge was to build a static web app using only HTML5, CSS, Javascript, and 3rd party services. No backend server work could be used. Oh, and all of this needed to be completed, start to finish, in 48 hours.

This was a fun contest and a good learning experience. We got to build an app while playing with a bunch of new tools. These tools included [goinstant](https://goinstant.com/), [divshot](http://www.divshot.io/), and [Facebook’s React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) with a [Backbone.js Router](http://backbonejs.org/#Router). Its impressive what you can accomplish with these services.

The downside was that me and my team had a lot of outside activities over the weekend. We didn't get to spend close to 48 hours working on our app. It was also difficult for us to get everyone in the same place at the same time. So we had to do a lot of communication using email, Google Hangout’s, and shared folder on Dropbox.

You should check out the [challenge submissions](http://www.staticshowdown.com/app/entries). There is some great stuff, from games, to productivity, to our own attempt at a [tap-finding system](http://www.staticshowdown.com/app/teams/df1fc2a289193fc458a72c8aa36153e4/entry). It’s cool seeing what people were able to by mashing up the difference services that we could use.

Once you check out some of the tools [described here](http://www.staticapps.org/articles/assembling-your-static-app-stack). They offer some great things that you can do with nothing more than front-end JavaScript.

I'll follow up with a few additional posts detailing more thoughts from my weekend of hacking.
