blurb: Why I chose to use GitHub Pages as my blogging platform..

I've wanted to start a blog for a long time. While waiting to start, I've
looked at a lot of different options. I liked GitHub Pages from the first time I
read about it a few years back. I actually decided at that time that it would be
my blogging platform when I start writing (I've been thinking
about doing this for a long time). Here are some of the reasons why I chose
GitHub Pages.

My top reason is because it is a developer's platform. GitHub primary function
is providing a service to developers - project hosting with git. When looking at
blogging platforms, I couldn't find a more
developer friendly platform. It lets me use git to manage my blog. It uses a
command line tool (Jekyll) to generate the blog. And I can choose
most of the tools that are involved with building my blog. Publishing content to
my blog is as simple as running a git push command. Really, most of my
management only requires opening and using a terminal. I love working in a
terminal, and love that I can continue to do so when working on my blog.

The next reason I chose GitHub Pages is for it's simplicity of setup. Most platforms
that are this flexible require you to setup a server. This usually ends up with
me in a mess of server setup and maintenance. That typically introduces
unncessary distractions -- instead of writing blog posts, I end up working on
the server. Don't get me wrong, I like working on servers. But messing with them
really doesn't help me publish new content. Instead, GitHub has made this
platform very easy to setup -- almost as simple as runnint git init on a new
project repository. After starting your repo and [following some
instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-project-pages-manually://help.github.com/categories/20/articles),
you have your blog up, running, and capable of publishing your content.

A third reason is openess of GitHub Pages. Because my blog is hosted on a [public
repository](https://github.com/shortpgh/site/tree/gh-pages), anyone can see how
I am managing my blog. Because of this openness,
you can easily flip over to GitHub and see how I'm doing something on this blog.

And Finally, I chose GitHub Pages because of the control I have when it comes to
my HTML, CSS, and Javascript. While Jekyll ships with some templates, you can
completely overwrite those templates to make your own markup. Then you can
choose whichever CSS pre-processor you want to use (or none at all). I chose to
use [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/) to give me a chance to learn
it while setting up this project.

These are only a few of the reasons why I chose GitHub Pages. Really, they are
the ones that I find most important. If you are a developer and are tired of the
big and bloated blogging patterns, I highly suggest giving GitHub Pages a try.
