I'm using Github pages for this site. While I'm getting started, I wanted to
post a few first impressions while working in this process.

# The Good Stuff

The getting started documentation is a great way to get started. You don't need
more than the initial Github pages guide, Jekyll documentation, and Markdown
reference to start writing your posts.

The deploy process is very easy. All you have to do is publish to your github
repo and your changes are there a few minutes later.

I control the markup. I can make my code accessible, use microdata where I want,
and play with all of the new HTML5 elements.

I control the CSS. This lets me use pre-processors. And I'm writing in CSS or
the pre-processor syntax. I'm not trying to learn some blogging platform or
CMS's crazy way of doing things to style my pages.

I can write my posts in Vim. This might be my favorite aspect of using this
platform. I fire up my TMUX session, turn on my watch commands, and can start
typing. It does make me realize I need to learn how to spell check in Vim. I'm
an aweful speller, but never worried about my spelling mistakes when writing
code.

# The Bad Stuff

You get very little out of the box. There are not pretty styles, so you're stuck
with whatever I can come up with. I.E., this very bland page.

The amount of flexibility is counter productive. I've found myself spending more
time trying to work in different tools or style my site than writing content.
To combat this problem, I decided to stip down the styling to be very basic
until I have some content to style. Only once I have some substantial content
will I start to style agin.
