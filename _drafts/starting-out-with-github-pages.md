I've wanted to start a blog for a long time. When Github pages was originally
announced, I didn't have a blog and thought about using that as a platform to
start one. But at the time, I didn't know what to write about. So I forgot about
Github pages.

Recently, I've made it a personal goal to start writing. I already started doing
this on my employer's blog, but I also want my own place to write. And at the
same time, I started hearing some great discussions about both Github pages and
Jekyll on podcasts. This reminded me of my interest in Github Pages.

I chose github pages because I find it to be developer friendly. It allows me to
write my posts in VIM. It lets me write my own style sheets and use a
pre-processor like Stylus and Sass.

One of the problems with github pages is that you don't get the pretty,
designer-created, default templates that so many other  blogging platforms
provide. This has also been a problem in getting this site live. Instead of
writing content, I've been focusing on the design of my page and the tools
around using it. This almost lead me to chose a different platform.

But honestly, the control over my markup is well worth this sacrifice.
