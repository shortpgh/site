After spending the last few years on iOS, I decided to switch to Android and bought a Nexus 5. There were a lot of things that I looked at when trying to decide which phone to buy. But there was one thing that actually sold me on android. That is Chrome.

Chrome is my favorite and most-used piece of software. I spend a good deal of my time, both mobile and non-mobile, in a web browser. I used Chrome on my iPhone, but the experience wasn't as good as on the desktop. I really wanted a better browser experience on my phone. I didn't believe an new iPhone could deliver it to me. Chrome for Android has delivered the experience that I wanted. After a few months with this device, I find myself using the browser instead of downloading the apps. Its especially nice for those apps that I don't use very often.

The main feature that attracted me to Android is [DevTools remote debugging](https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/remote-debugging). Its great being able to plug it in and debug my mobile bugs right on my phone. I’ve already fixed a few bugs faster than I've previously been able to fix them. It’s great for diagnosing mobile performance on the sites I build. I can switch off WiFi and test performance on cellular networks. Its amazing being able to profile the site on different networks with DevTools.

I know this is can be done on Safari on an iPhone, but it’s limited to Mac only. I can connect my Android to both my work and home computers - windows and Mac - without a problem.

Overall, I'm please with my decision. Android does have its quirks, but no more than the iPhone. Its been a boost professionally with remote debugging. I feel like I have a phone that I can actually use for work. This is primarily because of Chrome on Android.

If you work in the web, I highly suggest getting an Android for this remote debugging capability. Its really a boost to mobile web development. You don't have to make it your primary device. A Nexus 7 is an affordable way to get this capability and give you a small tablet to test.
