    <h2>Watch the Experts, then Watch Others</h2>
    <p>You can find plenty of videos to teach you all of the cool stuff that
    DevTools can do. Watch a few of them. I highly suggest starting  <a
    href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZH1d2Co1X0">Paul Irish's Chrome Summit
    Talk</a>. Then just search <a
    href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=DevTools">search for
    DevTools</a> on <a href="http://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a>. Pick a few that look
    interesting. Watching these videos is the quickest path to get you moving on
    all of the cool features DevTools offers.</p>

    <h2>Read the Docs</h2>
    <p>Google provides a tremendous research on the <a
    href="https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/">DevTools</a>
    site. It can be overwhelming how much there is to read, so here are a few
    links to start with.
    <ul>
        <li><a
        href="https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/tips-and-tricks">Tips
        and Tricks</a></li>

        Shortcuts</a></li>
        <li><a

        Styles and the DOM</a></li>

        href="https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/authoring-development-workflow">Authoring
        and Development Workflow</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Experiment!</h2>
    <p>Nothing beats working with it. Once you read or watch about something
    new, give it a spin. Try to use DevTools as your primary front-end code
    editor for a day. Make yourself use the Keyboard Shortcuts. Write some
    Javascript in the console. Check out the extensions available for DevTools
    and see if any of them can improve your workflow even more.</p>
